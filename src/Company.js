          <img src={living_wage} alt="response"/>
          </div>
          <p>A living wage policy requires employers to pay a wage at or above the federal or state poverty line. Living wages are generally set as the wage a full time worker would need to support a family of four above the federal poverty line.</p>
          <div>
          <h4>Anti Abuse Policy?</h4>
          <img src={anti_abuse} alt="response"/>
          </div>
          <p>Abuse and harassment policies are in place to educate employees about abusive and inappropriate behavior. These policies define what is considered workplace harassment, prohibited conduct, and the specific types of behavior that violate the policies. They also outline the consequences for engaging in harassing and abusive activities as well as complaint procedures. </p>
          <div>
          <h4>Equal Pay Pledge?</h4>
          <img src={equal_pay} alt="response"/>
          </div>
          <p>By signing the Equal Pay Pledge, signatories agree to conduct an annual, company-wide gender pay analysis, review hiring and promotion procedures to reduce unconscious bias and structural barriers, and promote best practices to close the pay gap.
